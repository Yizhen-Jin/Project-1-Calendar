# Project-1-Calendar

index.HTML
- I searched how to make a popup then I took and edit the code to be "Add a task" that we can put a task name, select task category, and select the time in order to set the priority
- For the calendar, I use html table and devide time into 30-minute sections, which means tasks with the time input xx:00 and xx:30 will only work

style.css
- I also got the css code from pop-up reference and did not change anything, so we might need to work with this later

problem with index.HTML
- After clicking the submit button, the input data did not appear in the table. If you look at line 56 and 57, I put the code to see if the data receiver work. When I tried selecting 08:00 AM as the time for task and clicked submit, the input data appeared for a second and gone. So I guess there might be some errors between line 26 and 57.
